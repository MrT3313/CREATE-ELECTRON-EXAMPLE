## ðŸš§ Project Status: Beta ðŸš§

> [!WARNING]
> This project is in its early stages. While it's ready for you to try out, expect breaking changes and incomplete features.
>
> **Platform Support:** Currently, `create-electron-foundation` is developed and tested primarily on **macOS**.
>
> **Windows** _(and **Linux** if I can get pewdiepie on the line...)_ support is planned for the future, but full functionality is not yet **guaranteed** on those platforms.

## ðŸš§ Prerequisites ðŸš§

- make
  this project uses makefiles to build & manage the project.

- nvm
  To ensure compatibility and smooth development, it's generally recommended to use a Node.js version manager. These help you easily switch between Node.js versions as needed for different projects.

  This project makefile management is strongly integrated with [**nvm**](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and it is recommended that you have it installed on your machine when interacting create-electron-foundation or its scaffolded assets.

## What's Included?

`create-electron-foundation` scaffolds a project with a sensible default stack, but gives you the flexibility to opt out of what you don't need.

- **Framework:** [`Electron`](https://www.electronjs.org/) (with a modern main/renderer process setup)
- **Frontend:** [`React`](https://react.dev/) w/[`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (via [`Vite`](https://vitejs.dev/))

You can also choose to include:

- **Routing:** [`TanStack Router`](https://tanstack.com/router) or [`React Router`](https://reactrouter.com/)
- **Styling:** [`Tailwind`](https://tailwindcss.com/) or `Vanilla CSS`
- **Database:** [`SQLite`](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
- **ORM:** [`Drizzle ORM`](https://orm.drizzle.team/) (when SQLite is selected)

## Getting Started

To create a new Electron application, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-electron-foundation@latest
npx create-electron-foundation # will call @latest
npx create-electron-foundation@beta
npx create-electron-foundation@alpha
```

The CLI will guide you through a few interactive prompts to configure your project.

### Quick Start (Default Configuration)

To skip the prompts and scaffold a project with the default options, use the `-y` flag:

```bash
npx create-electron-foundation@beta -y
```

**Default Stack:**

- Router: **Tanstack Router**
- Styling: **Tailwind CSS**

## Command-Line Arguments

You can also customize your project setup directly via command-line arguments.
