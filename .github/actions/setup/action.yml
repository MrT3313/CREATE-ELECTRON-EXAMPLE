# ==================================================================================================
# SUMMARY
# ==================================================================================================
# This file defines a GitHub Actions "composite action".
#
# Purpose:
#   To provide a reusable set of steps for setting up a Node.js environment specifically for projects
#   using NPM (Node Package Manager). It aims to standardize the environment setup across different
#   jobs and workflows within the repository, ensuring consistency and reducing duplication.
#
# Key Steps:
#   1. Set up Node.js and Cache Dependencies: Installs a specified version of Node.js and configures
#      caching for the global npm cache directory (~/.npm). This speeds up subsequent workflow runs
#      by reusing previously downloaded packages if the package-lock.json has not changed.
#   2. Install dependencies: Runs 'npm ci' to perform a clean and reproducible installation of
#      project dependencies based on the 'package-lock.json' file.
#
# Inputs:
#   - node-version: (Optional) The version of Node.js to install. Defaults to '20'.
#
# Usage:
#   This action is intended to be called from other workflow files using:
#     uses: ./.github/actions/setup
#     with:
#       node-version: 'your-desired-node-version' # Optional

# A description of what the composite action does.
description: 'Sets up Node.js, caches NPM dependencies, and installs them using npm ci.'

# Defines the inputs that this composite action accepts.
inputs:
  # Input for specifying the Node.js version.
  node-version:
    description: 'Node.js version to use'
    required: false # This input is optional.
    default: '20' # Default value if not provided by the caller.

# Defines the execution logic for this composite action.
runs:
  # Specifies that this is a composite action, meaning its steps run directly on the runner machine.

  # Sequence of steps to execute when this action runs.
  steps:
    # Uses the official 'actions/setup-node' action.
    # This will also make npm available and handle caching.
